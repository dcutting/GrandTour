# GrandTour

A sample app written using several different architectures to accompany a talk, _The Grand Tour of iOS Architectures_.

Each branch corresponds to a different architecture for the same app, with the same set of features.

Architectures implemented so far:

* Apple MVC
* MVP
* [Coordinator](http://khanlou.com/2015/10/coordinators-redux/)
* [VIPER](https://www.objc.io/issues/13-architecture/viper/)

Pull requests for alternative architectures very welcome!
